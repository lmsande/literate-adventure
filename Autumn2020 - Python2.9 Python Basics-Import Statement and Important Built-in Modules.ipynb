    "\n",
    "#### Three things:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Usually, in Python scripts, we put all the import statements at the beginning of our script. Why is that? To see what modules our script relies on. Also, to make sure that the modules will be imported before we need to apply them. So keep this advice in mind: **python import statement and built-in modules - import at the beginning of the script**\n",
    "\n",
    "2. In this lecture note, we applied the functions of the modules using this syntax: `module_name.function_name`(parameters)\n",
    "\n",
    "```markdown\n",
    "Eg. statistics.median(a)\n",
    "\n",
    "or, csv.reader(csvfile, delimiter=';'). This is logical: before you apply a given function, you have to tell Python in which module to find it.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In some cases there are even more complicated relationships – like functions of classes in a module (eg. `datetime.datetime.now`()) but let’s not confuse yourself with that for now. \n",
    "\n",
    "My suggestion is to make a list of your favorite modules and functions and learn how they work; if you need a new one, check out the original Python documentation and add the new module plus its function to your list.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. When you import a module (or a package) you can rename it using the as keyword:\n",
    "If you type:\n",
    "\n",
    "```markdown\n",
    "import statistics as stat\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You have to refer to your module as `stat`. Eg. `stat.median`(a) and not as statistics.median(a). Conventionally, we are using two very well-known data science related Python libraries imported with their shortened name: \n",
